# Copy to .env.local (for local development) or set as environment variables on Vercel

# URL of your backend API (include https:// in production)
# Example (Render): https://your-backend.onrender.com/
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-backend.example.com/

# Optional: allow the frontend to know its public URL (useful for absolute links)
# Not required by the app, but sometimes helpful for runtime checks
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_URL=https://your-frontend.example.com/

# Notes:
# - NEXT_PUBLIC_* variables are exposed to client-side code. Do not put secrets here.
# - For deployment, set NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL to the Render (backend) URL and ensure
#   the backend's CLIENT_URL env is set to your frontend URL so cookies + CORS work.
